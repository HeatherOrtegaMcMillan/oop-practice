    "Answer the following questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is a class?\n",
    "    - A type of object \n",
    "- What is an instance?\n",
    "    - instance of object\n",
    "    - instance = class()\n",
    "- What is encapsulation?\n",
    "    - data hiding\n",
    "    - public and private access to methods and properties of objects.\n",
    "    - can change with getter and setter functions\n",
    "    - don't give everyone access to the properties\n",
    "- What is abstraction?\n",
    "    - Only exposing the necessary details to the user of the object.\n",
    "- What is inheritance?\n",
    "    - Allows for code resuability. Can create sub classes from super classes (or child - parent).  \n",
    "- What is multiple inheritance?\n",
    "    - More levels of child level classes\n",
    "- What is polymorphism?\n",
    "    - Comes from many and forms\n",
    "    - Allows you to determine what function to run while the program is running\n",
    "    - call methods on a class if what's calling it is a pointer of a parent object\n",
    "    - if it's overridden by a child class it will call that\n",
    "- What is method resolution order or MRO?\n",
    "    - Will only go up the chain in order to find the correct method to use. up meaning closer to the parent. \n",
    "\n",
    "Part 2\n",
    "Create a deck of cards class. Internally, the deck of cards should use another class, a card class. Your requirements are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Deck class should have a deal method to deal a single card from the deck\n",
    "- After a card is dealt, it is removed from the deck.\n",
    "- There should be a shuffle method which makes sure the deck of cards has all 52 cards and then rearranges them randomly.\n",
    "- The Card class should have a suit (Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, Spades) and a value (A,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,J,Q,K)"
